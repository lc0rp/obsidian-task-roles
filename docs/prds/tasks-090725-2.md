# Task: Simplify default roles schema

Right now the Role interface is defined like this

```ts
export interface Role {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	aliases?: string[];
	description: string;
	icon: string;
	iconAliases?: string[];
	/** Single letter shortcut used for quick role selection */
	shortcut?: string;
	shortcutAliases?: string[];
	isDefault: boolean;
	order: number;
}
```

Example:

```ts
{
    id: "owner",
    name: "Owner",
    aliases: ["user", "responsible", "driver", "assignee"],
    description:
        "Executes the task, or drives the decision. For basic task assignment, keep this role and disable the rest.",
    icon: "ðŸ‘¤",
    shortcut: "o",
    shortcutAliases: ["u", "r", "d", "a"],
    isDefault: true,
    order: 1,
},
```

Issues: lots of duplication:
- id, name, aliases all have the same purpose, to identify the role
- isDefault is refundant

Changes Requested:
- Remove 'isDefault'
- Keep 'id' the same
- Combine name and aliases into a single field called "names". Always an array of strings, the first element is the primary name (this can be changed in settings). All lower case, but display changes the first letter to uppercase when displaying.
- Plural handling: an optional field "pluralNames" can be added to specify the plural form any of the names. If this object doesn't exist or a name doesn't have a plural specified, the plural is generated by simply adding 's' to the end of the name. Example:

```ts
names: ["owner", "user", "responsible", "driver", "assignee"],
pluralNames: {"responsible": "responsible"}
```

In this example, the plural of "responsible" is "responsible" (same as singular), while the plurals of "owner", "user", "driver", and "assignee" are generated as "owners", "users", "drivers", and "assignees".

- Similarly, combine shortcut and shortcutAliases into a single field called "shortcuts". Always an array of strings, the first element is the primary shortcut. All lower case but always displayed with a leading backslash.

Therefore, new interface:

```ts
export interface Role {
	id: string;
	names: string[];
	pluralNames?: object;
	description: string;
	icon: string;
	shortcuts: string[];
	order: number;
}
```

Analyze the code and update it to work with the new interface. Update documents and tests as well, where necessary.
