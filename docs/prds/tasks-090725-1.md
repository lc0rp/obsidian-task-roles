1. More customization options for default roles

In the plugin settings, update the default roles section as described below:

Section Heading - Default roles (unchanged)

Add description: The default roles are flexible enough to support project management techniques like RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted & Informed) & DACI (Driver, Approver, Contributor, Informed), or simple task assignment. Customize the roles below.

Then, for each role, make the following customizations:
(Choose the UI that works best for UX and is supported by Obsidian, either a table, or individual sections for each role, tabs, or a button that pops up a form for each role, or tabs, you're the UX design expert. Prioritize user experience.)
- Keep the icon and role name
- Use the custom description for each role
- Add the following customization controls
    - Preferred name: select box of name + aliases, defaults to name. Changing this changes the displayed role name instantly
    - Icon: icon. Clicking it pops up the OS emoji picker to enable customization. Validates: must be unique among enabled default and custom roles. Changing this changes the displayed role icon instantly
    - Shortcut: select box of shortcut default + aliases. (prepended by \, e.g. \o, \r...)
    - Enable/disable toggle - enabled by default. (This exists, keep it)
- Add a reset defaults button that will reset all changes made to the default roles.

Update tests and documentation accordingly.
