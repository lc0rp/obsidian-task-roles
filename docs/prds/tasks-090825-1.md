# Task: Organize settings

I like the Default Roles section, and want to replicate that layout for the other settings sections.

## A. The Person and Company sections

Introduce an "Assignees" section at the top that uses the same style, with a description: You can assign tasks to people or companies. Each person or company is stored as a note. Customize the settings below.

Then, create two sections side by side, and move the following content into them:
- Person section (left)
	- Tab: Person settings
	- Heading: Person
	- Description: A person is anyone you might assign a task to.
	- Person prefix setting
	- Person directory setting
	- Create @me person button
- Company section (right)
	- Tab: Company settings
	- Heading: Company
	- Description: A company is an organization or group of people you might assign a task to.
	- Company prefix setting
	- Company directory setting

Move the "Show inline role assignment icons" setting within this section but below the tabs, not part of any tab.

## B. The Custom Roles section

Introduce a "Custom Roles" section after the Default Roles section that uses the same style, with a description: You can create custom roles to fit your workflow. Customize the settings below.

Then, create two sections side by side, and move the following content into them:
- Custom roles section (left)
	- Tab: Custom roles
	- Heading: Custom Roles
	- Description: Custom roles help you organize tasks in a way that fits your workflow.
	- Content: List of existing custom roles with their edit and delete buttons
- Add new role section (right)
	- Tab: Add new role
	- Heading: Add New Role
	- Description: Create a new custom role to categorize your tasks.
	- Role name: input field
	- Role description: input field
	- Icon: input field
	- Shortcut letter: input field

Update documents and tests where necessary.

Finish up with a conventional commit message.
