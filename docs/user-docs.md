# Task Roles

Track who owns a task, who needs to be informed about it, who to follow up with, and more.

"Task Roles" lets you assign roles, people, and companies to tasks using DACI (Driver, Approver, Contributor
, Informed) methodology.

## Features

### 🎯 Quick Role Updates

- **One-click role update**: A person icon (👤) appears at the end of every task line for instant access
- **Smart detection**: Icons appear automatically when you start typing task content
- **Natural workflow**: The cursor stays between the checkbox and icon, so you can type naturally

### 👥 Person & Company Management

- Link tasks to people using `@` prefix (e.g., `@John`)
- Link tasks to companies using `+` prefix (e.g., `+AcmeCorp`)
- Auto-complete suggestions from configured directories
- Special `@me` person for self-reference

### 🎭 Default Roles, based on DACI methodology

- **Owner** 👤: Who is responsible for driving the task forward
- **Approver** 👍: Who needs to approve the task
- **Contributor** 👥: Who will contribute to the task
- **Informed** 📢: Who needs to be kept informed
- **Quick shortcuts**: Type `\o`, `\a`, `\c` or `\i` to insert role fields. Custom roles can define their own letter.
  This also works inside `tasks` or `taskview` query blocks, where the shortcut inserts `👤 =` style markup.
- **Smart filtering**: Role suggestions only show roles that aren't already present on the task line

### ⚙️ Customizable Roles

- Add custom roles with your own icons
- Hide default roles you don't need
- Reorder roles by priority

### 📋 Task Center

The Task Center provides a comprehensive task management interface with advanced filtering, multiple view layouts, and
real-time task tracking.

#### **Opening the Task Center**

1. **Command Palette**: Use "Open Task Center" command
2. **Ribbon Icon**: Click the users icon in the left ribbon (if enabled)
3. **Hotkey**: Configure a keyboard shortcut for quick access

#### **Task Details Side Panel**

Clicking a task card opens a detailed side panel showing:

- Full task description
- File location and line number
- Current status and priority
- All assigned roles and assignees
- Complete date information (created, due, scheduled, completed, modified)
- Tags

#### **View Configuration Management**

- **Load Configurations**: Quickly apply saved view configurations
- **Configuration Autocomplete**: Type existing configuration names to overwrite
- **Configuration Display**: Shows currently loaded configuration name in header

#### **Real-Time Task Processing**

The Task Center uses task queries to process tasks in real-time:

- Automatically scans all markdown files for tasks using task queries
- Updates in real-time when files are modified, created, or deleted
- Parses comprehensive task metadata including:
  - Roles and assignees
  - Dates (due, scheduled, completed, created, modified)
  - Priority levels (🔴 Urgent, 🟡 High, 🟢 Low, or text indicators)
  - Status (including custom indicators like 🚧 for in-progress, ❌ for cancelled)
  - Tags
  - File metadata

## Usage

### Quick Role Addition and Updates with Icons

1. Create a task: `- [ ] Complete project documentation`
2. Start typing after the checkbox - a users icon automatically appears at the end
3. Click the icon to open the role edit dialog
4. Select roles and assign people/companies

### Role Format

When you assign a role to a task, it gets formatted using dataview inline format:
`[icon:: comma-separated assignees]`

Example: `[👤:: @John, @Jane] [👍:: @Manager]`

The plugin also supports reading the legacy format for backward compatibility.

### Task Metadata Support

The plugin recognizes and parses various task metadata formats:

**Priority Indicators:**

- 🔴 or `[urgent]` or `!!!` → Urgent priority
- 🟡 or `[high]` or `!!` → High priority
- 🟢 or `[low]` → Low priority
- No indicator → Medium priority (default)

**Status Indicators:**

- `[x]` or `[X]` → Done
- 🚧 or `[in-progress]` → In Progress
- ❌ or `[cancelled]` → Cancelled
- `[ ]` → To Do (default)

**Date Formats:**

- `due: 2024-01-15`
- `scheduled: 2024-01-15`
- `completed: 2024-01-15`
- `📅 2024-01-15`
- `[due:: 2024-01-15]`

**Tags:**

- Standard Obsidian tags: `#project #urgent`

## Ways to Assign

1. **Click the person icon**: Appears automatically at the end of task lines
2. **"Assign task roles to People/Companies" command**: Use on any checkbox item (task)
3. **Keyboard shortcut**: Configurable shortcut to trigger the role edit dialog
4. **Inline typing**: Type role icon + space + `@` or `+` to trigger auto-suggest
5. **Role shortcuts**: Type `\` followed by a role shortcut letter (e.g., `\o` for Owner) - only shows roles not already
   assigned

## Editing Roles

Select "Assign or Update Roles" on a task that already has roles setup to edit them. Only known,
unhidden roles will be parsed and displayed.

## Settings

- **Change @ symbol**: Customize person prefix (affects future data only)
- **Change + symbol**: Customize company prefix (affects future data only)
- **Select @ directory**: Choose directory for people (affects future data only)
- **Select + directory**: Choose directory for companies (affects future data only)
- **Create @me person**: Button to create the special @me person if it doesn't exist
- **Use compact filters**: Display all filters in a single horizontal line instead of the collapsible panel
- **Enable debug logging**: Log additional information to the console
- **Assign or Update Roles**:
  - Hide default roles (prevents them from appearing in future dialogs)
  - Add, edit, and delete custom roles
  - Note: Editing custom roles won't update historical records

### Default roles customization

The default roles are flexible enough to support RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) and DACI (Driver, Approver, Contributor, Informed) frameworks, or simple single‑assignee workflows. Customize them in Settings → Task Roles:

- Preferred name: choose between the role’s name and its aliases (e.g., Owner vs Driver). Updates the displayed label instantly.
- Icon: click to type/paste an emoji. Must be unique among enabled roles. Updates everywhere instantly.
- Shortcut: pick the backslash shortcut from the default and its aliases (e.g., \o or \d).
- Enable/disable: toggle visibility of each default role.
- Reset defaults: restore all default roles to their original names, icons, shortcuts, and re‑enable them.

## Installation

### From Obsidian Community Plugins

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to Community Plugins
3. Search for "Task Roles"
4. Install and enable the plugin

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Extract the files to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-task-roles/` folder
3. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in settings

## How It Works

The plugin uses CodeMirror editor extensions to:

- Detect task lines in real-time
- Add clickable person icons at the end of task lines
- Maintain cursor position between checkbox and icon
- Trigger role edit dialogs when icons are clicked

This approach is similar to how TaskNotes implements their functionality, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Editor** (`editor/`) - CodeMirror extensions and auto-suggestions
- **Modals** (`modals/`) - Dialog windows for role & assignee editing, and view saving
- **Views** (`views/`) - Task Center implementation with filtering and layout management
- **Settings** (`settings/`) - Configuration and preferences

### Key Components

**Core Services:**

- **TaskQueryService** - Task query building and real-time task processing
- **TaskRolesService** - Role & assignee parsing, formatting, and file operations
- **ViewConfigurationService** - Saved view management

**UI Components:**

- **TaskRolesView** - Main Task Center interface
- **TaskRolesInlineWidget** - Inline task roles icon for tasks
- **AssignmentModel** - Role & assignee update dialog
- **TaskRolesSaveViewModal** - View configuration saving interface

**Editor Integration:**
